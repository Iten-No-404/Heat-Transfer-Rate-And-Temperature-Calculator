<p align='justify'>
This is a Thermodynamics course project, which in more detail is a python program that calculates the heat transfer rate and the value of temperature anywhere in the medium for steady one-dimensional heat conduction in a plane wall whose thermal conductivity varies linearly as k(T) = ko(1 + Œ≤T) where the constants ko and Œ≤ are specified by the user for specified temperature boundary conditions.
The actual project you have here goes beyond the scope of th requirements in that:
<br> ‚ô†Ô∏è It features a decent GUI.
<br> ‚ô£Ô∏è It isn't restricted to plane walls (also cylinderical and spherical ones.)
<br> ‚ô•Ô∏è It graphs the solution.
